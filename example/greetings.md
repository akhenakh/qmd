Hi everyone

## You Won’t Get It Until You Use Them

I can’t not sound like a shill. Sprites are the one thing we’ve shipped that I personally experience as addictive. I haven’t fully put my finger on why it feels so much easier to kick off projects now that I can snap my finger and get a whole new computer. The whole point is that there’s no reason to parcel them out, or decide which code should run where. You just make a new one.

So to make this fully click, I think you should just install the sprite command, make a Sprite, and then run an agent in it. We’ve preinstalled Claude, Gemini, and Codex, and taught them how to do things like checkpoint/restore, registering services, and getting logs. Claude will run in --dangerously-skip-permissions mode (because why wouldn’t it). Have it build something; I built a “Chicago’s best sandwich” bracket app for a Slack channel.

Sprites bill only for what you actually use (in particular: only for storage blocks you actually write, not the full 100GB capacity). It’s reasonable to create a bunch. They’re ball-point disposable computers. After you get a feel for them, it’ll start to feel weird not having them handy.
